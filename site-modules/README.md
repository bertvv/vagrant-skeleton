# Site-local Puppet modules

This directory should contain only Puppet modules that are specific to this site/project. As a consequense, it makes sense to keep them under source control within this repository (and not as submodules). Generic or third party modules should be kept in another repository and managed through `librarian-puppet` under the `modules/` directory.
